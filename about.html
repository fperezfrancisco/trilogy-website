            “ I created Trilogy soccer with the sole intention of helping a
            community of motivated soccer athletes become their very best. Now,
            this wasn’t an idea I simply stumbled upon but something I had been
            contemplating well throughout my soccer career. I knew one day I
            would give back to the next generation of athletes and give onto
            them all of my knowledge, passion, and discipline I had acquired
            throughout my own journey. <br /><br />I grew up playing soccer here
            in the Santa Clarita Valley. I played for AYSO, SCV Magic, Real
            SoCal, Real SoCal Academy, and ultimately I was granted a
            scholarship to play at one of the top Universities in the country,
            UC Berkeley. It was here where I realized how many opportunities the
            sport of soccer could open for anyone including myself, a
            first-generation college student with immigrant parents. I knew then
            that I wanted to help others achieve similar opportunities with the
            sport of soccer to help open those doors. After completing my BA in
            Applied Mathematics, I returned home in the summer of 2021 to begin
            on a new journey as a coach and mentor. I can’t wait to see what the
            future holds for me, my team, and the Trilogy Athletes. I just know
            that with some hard work, dedication, and time, it won’t be long
            before others reach their own goals and dreams.”
